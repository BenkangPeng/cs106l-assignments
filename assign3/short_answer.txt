Make a Class
------------

Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness is the practice of using keyward `const` in C++ to explicity specity 
which parts of the code are immutable. It ensures that objects, functions and member function
behave predictably when deaing with constant data. It's important that const-correctness can 
prevent accidental modifications and improves code readability and maintainability. It can
also enable compiler optimizations and supports STL and generic programming.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. Maybe yes... Any member functions that don't modify member variables of the class
are set as const functions, and any actual parameters that don't be modified are set as const
variables.
